Final LinkedIn Post: The "War Story"
Selected Strategy: Option 1 (High Engagement / Engineering Credibility)

Headline: Paper Architects draw lines. Real Engineers fight DNS.

Body: Most "Enterprise AI" diagrams are lies. They show a clean line from "User" to "AI Model." They forget the firewall. They forget the latency. And they definitely forget that privatelink.openai.azure.com refuses to resolve correctly when you're 3 hops deep in a Hub-Spoke VNet.

I just deployed a Regulator-Ready AI Platform (UK South). It wasn't easy. Here are the 3 ugly truths I documented in my latest breakdown:

🛑 1. The "Premium" Tax If you want IDPS and WAF, your baseline cost is ~$3k/month before the first token is generated. Security is an investment, not a feature.

⏱️ 2. Physics is Real Front Door -> Hub -> Spoke -> APIM adds ~20ms. If you don't have a semantic cache (Redis) sidecar, your users will hate you.

🔗 3. DNS is the Final Boss Hybrid identity + Private Resolver is the only way to survive.

I’ve shared the full Blueprint (v5), the Terraform code, and the "Junior Engineer's Glossary" to help you build this yourself.
